# pathfinding-algorithm
This pathfinding alogorithm has been made with Pygame, Math and PriorityQueue to find the shortest and best possible path to get to the end point. Here the orange point  indicates the  start point and the purple point  indicates the end point and the black points indicate the barrrier. After riunning the algorithm we can see that the algorithm shows the shortest possible path with the yellow color.
